Contacts
========

Snaked has no own site (likely will never have), and development related
tasks go around `github`_ including `issues`_ tracking.

I understand that not all users have GH account, so will provide additional
contacts to communicate with me.

* e-mail: bobrov_at_vl.ru or baverman_at_gmail.com. Later I check no so often.

* twitter: `@a_bobrov`_.

* `blog`_. 

I need feedback from other Snaked's users, feel free to post any bugs,
suggestions or ideas. I have some free time and can reply and implement
features fast enough.
